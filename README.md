Welcome to the Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Project! This project aims to analyze historical employee data from the 1980s and 1990s at Pewlett Hackard, a fictional company. By exploring this dataset, you'll gain insights into the company's workforce demographics, hiring trends, and departmental structures during that period.

Project Overview

As a data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, your primary tasks include:

Data Modeling: Designing an appropriate table schema to store the employee data from CSV files. This involves identifying key attributes, defining relationships between tables, and ensuring data integrity.

Data Engineering: Creating the database tables based on the defined schema and importing the data from CSV files. This step involves executing SQL commands to set up the database and populate it with the employee data.

Data Analysis: Performing SQL queries on the database to extract valuable insights about the company's historical workforce. This includes answering specific questions about employee demographics, tenure, salary distributions, and more.

Repository Contents

Inside this repository, you'll find:

Starter_Code SQL -> 
data -> 
This directory contains the six CSV files containing the employee data for the 1980s and 1990s. Use these CSV files to import data to your tables, OR create a ERD using https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/.

EmployeeSQL ->

schema.sql: This SQL script file contains the table schema definitions. You can execute this script to create the database tables.

queries.sql: This SQL script file contains sample queries for data analysis. You can run these queries against the database to extract insights.

README.md: This README file provides an overview of the project and instructions for setting up the database and performing data analysis.
